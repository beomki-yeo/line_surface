Line surface used for wire measurements or perigee surface is an unique type of surface where the intersections of a track is not defined on a physical plane. Due to this trait, the underlying mathematics gets quite complicated especially with coordinate transform jacobian. In this white paper, we attempt to derive the jacobians for both of local-to-global and global-to-local transforms.
